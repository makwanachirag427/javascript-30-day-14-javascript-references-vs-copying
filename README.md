# JavaScript30: Day 14 - JS Reference VS Copy

Today's challenge in the JavaScript30 course focused on understanding and implementing efficient copying techniques in JavaScript. This knowledge is crucial for manipulating data effectively and preventing unintended side effects.

## Concepts Covered

- **Shallow Copying:**
  Shallow copying involves creating a new object or array that holds references to the original elements. Changes made in the copy affect the original, so caution is needed to avoid unexpected modifications.

- **Deep Copying:**
  Deep copying creates an entirely new object or array, duplicating all elements. Changes in the copy do not affect the original, ensuring data integrity and isolation.

## Efficient Copying Techniques

1. **Spread Operator (...)**
   - Shallow copy for arrays and objects.
   - Simple and concise, widely used.

2. **Object.assign()**
   - Shallow copy for objects.
   - Merges objects, creating a new one.

3. **JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()**
   - Deep copy for objects and arrays.
   - Converts object to JSON and back, creating a new copy.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the provided examples and experiment with the different copying techniques in JavaScript. Understanding when to use each method is essential for writing efficient and maintainable code.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
